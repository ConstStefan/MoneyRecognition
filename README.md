# MoneyRecognition


Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify Romanian banknotes (1 leu, 5 lei, 10 lei, 100 lei, 200 lei) based on images. The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with image data augmentation techniques. Achieved accurate results in identifying different banknote denominations and implemented a prediction function that classifies new images.
